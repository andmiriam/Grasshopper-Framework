Three Laws of my Framework: 

1) It may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2) It must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3) It must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Ohhh, and also this is for me and not necessarily you but happy for comments, conversation and especially better ways of doing things. And I know this isn't groundbreaking, new or innovative. It borrows heavily and often from work done by others with a few things of my own through in for good measure.
