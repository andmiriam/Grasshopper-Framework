CSS Folder is set up to run with LESS. CSS can be compiled in a variety of methods, but the following instructions are for LESS.app (http://incident57.com/less/)

1. Open Less.app
2. Load up /css/less
3. Uncheck all files except styles.css
4. Set Output path to /css/
5. For IE support compile IE.css with the output path /css/

Styles.less compiles all CSS files except IE.css.
