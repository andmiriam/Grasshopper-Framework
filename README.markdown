# Wordpress Starting Framework

## Preamble
After frustration over finding a good starting place for my Wordpress projects I started collecting my personal best practice in a central place. As a custom theme developer I found that many themes had a lot of style already coded into them, were bloated to use or didn't have enough features. Hence, my starting point for projects. This isn't a theme as out of the box it doesn't really work. Don't believe me? Try it. 

## Goals
- no inherited style
- minimize uptime for a new project without reduction of theme
- up to date includes (jQuery, Modernizer) 
- as semantic as possible
- follow as many industry best practice as possible

## Usage
Given how many other published and personal frameworks are out there, I don't anticipate it to get a high level of adoption but is available for anyone to use. 

## Dependancies
This project uses LESS. If you don't use LESS, this isn't for you.

## Thanks
I've borrowed heavily from HTML5 boilerplate, plus countless Wordpress themes, frameworks, blog posts, articles. Thanks to everyone for making the WP community what it is.
